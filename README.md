# ObliqueStrategies

A Ruby gem for delivering a [Oblique Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies) in code and from the command line. With built in strategies, or bring
your own newline-delimited file. See the [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) file and the [build status](https://travis-ci.com/nodanaonlyzuul/oblique_strategies) for tested Ruby versions.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'oblique_strategies'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install oblique_strategies

## Usage

### In The Command Line

    $ oblique_strategies
    Change nothing and continue with immaculate consistency

### Fast & Dirty With Built-in Cards

```ruby
require 'oblique_strategies'

puts ObliqueStrategies.card
# "Is it finished?"
```

### Multiple Cards

The class method `card()` is a shortcut for instantiating an instance, and calling
the `card()` instance method. If you need multiple cards, you can avoid
re-reading the file by creating an instance of `ObliqueStrategies`.

```ruby
require 'oblique_strategies'

deck =  ObliqueStrategies.new()

deck.card
# "Cascades"

deck.card
# "Cut a vital connection"
```

### Bring Your Own

```ruby
require 'oblique_strategies'

deck =  ObliqueStrategies.new(path: '/path/to/your/file.txt')

deck.card
# "This does not bode well"

deck.card
# "Maybe later"
```

## Development
